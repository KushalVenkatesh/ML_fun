Whats the use of session  in tensorflow :

To do efficient numerical computing in Python, we typically use libraries like NumPy that 
do expensive operations such as matrix multiplication outside Python, using highly efficient 
code implemented in another language. Unfortunately, there can still be a lot of overhead from 
switching back to Python every operation. This overhead is especially bad if you want to run computations on
GPUs or in a distributed manner, where there can be a high cost to transferring data.

TensorFlow also does its heavy lifting outside python, but it takes things a step further to avoid this overhead. 
Instead of running a single expensive operation independently from Python, 
TensorFlow lets us describe a graph of interacting operations that run entirely outside Python. 
(Approaches like this can be seen in a few machine learning libraries.)
